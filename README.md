Project Purpose
The Digital Library Organizer shows how Recursion, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees (BST) work together to manage a digital library. It demonstrates how to display book categories, store detailed book info, and search titles efficiently.

Recursion: Displays nested categories and book titles.

Hash Table: Stores and retrieves book details like author, year, and genre.

BST: Sorts and searches book titles alphabetically.
